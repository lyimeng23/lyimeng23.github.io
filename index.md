<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>


Hi! I’m **Yimeng Liu**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Computer Science and Engineering** at [Michigan State University (MSU)](https://msu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Zhichao Cao](https://cse.msu.edu/~caozc/).  
I received my B.S. in Mathematics from [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) in 2023.  

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)** and **intelligent sensing systems**, with a strong emphasis on:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT, LoRA, QLoRA)  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for adaptive decision-making in simulation-to-real environments (e.g., CARLA)  
- **Computer Vision (CV)** for multimodal fusion and robust perception  
- **Wireless & mmWave radar sensing** for next-generation AIoT applications in autonomous systems and agriculture  

I have published in **ACM MobiCom (2024)**, **IEEE INFOCOM (2025)**, and **ACM SenSys (2025)**.  
Recent projects include **multimodal fusion for robust AI sensing**, **LLM + RL for cognitive-aware driving assistance**, and **cross-modality knowledge distillation for perception under adverse conditions**.
